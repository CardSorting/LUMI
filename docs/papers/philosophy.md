# LUMI: A Philosophy of Calm Agency

## I. Thesis

**A coding companion is not finished until you can keep it open all day without feeling managed by it.**

LUMI (`CardSorting.lumi`, `package.json` v2.1.3) is the **agent layer** of the [LUMI monorepo](https://github.com/CardSorting/LUMI): a VS Code extension that plans, proposes, and executes — but never assumes consent. Comfort is UX. **Agency with approval** is architecture.

BroccoliDB (`@noorm/broccolidb`) governs repository substrate — proof, repair, durable graph truth. LUMI governs **the human session** — chat, diffs, terminal, browser, MCP, governed swarm receipts, and the moment you click Approve.

Confusing the two — letting companion warmth substitute for approval discipline — is how agents become fluent without becoming trustworthy.

---

## II. The chain (implemented, not metaphor)

Each line maps to code you can open:

| Doctrine | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| User expresses intent | Chat input, @ mentions, slash commands |
| Controller holds session truth | `src/core/controller/index.ts` — class `Controller` |
| Task runs the loop | `src/core/task/index.ts` — observe → stream → tool → repeat |
| Tools are typed and routed | `DietCodeDefaultTool` in `src/shared/tools.ts` → `ToolExecutorCoordinator` |
| Host bridge executes physically | `HostProvider` → `src/hosts/vscode/hostbridge/` |
| Approval gates mutating work | Webview diff view + `autoApprove.ts` + user response |
| Hooks intercept lifecycle | 8 hook kinds in `src/core/hooks/hook-factory.ts` |
| Completion is earned | `completionGatePipeline.ts` + roadmap gates + audit checklist |
| Parallel lanes are governed | `use_subagents` → `GovernedSwarmCoordinator` + `LockNecessity` + `MergeGate` |
| Mutation earns ownership | `LockAuthority` — lease + fencing token; read lanes skip locks |
| Roadmap truth is coordinator-owned | Per-lane `agentRoadmap` projection + `proposedWorkspacePatch` → `commitWorkspaceRoadmapPatches` |
| Swarm truth is durable | Governed receipt schema v3 + `.governed.history.jsonl` — not chat status |
| Memory outlives chat | `@noorm/broccolidb` via cognitive memory tools + SQLite |
| Structure is provable | Spider via `src/core/policy/spider/` + `dietcode_kernel` tool |

```
Prompt     → parseMentions + parseSlashCommands
Session    → Controller + StateManager
Reason     → buildApiHandler → LLM stream
Act        → ToolExecutorCoordinator → handlers/*
Physical   → HostProvider.hostBridge (gRPC)
Consent    → Approve / Reject / Auto-approve rules
Finish     → attempt_completion → completionGatePipeline
Swarm      → classify intent → acquire projection → merge gate → reconcile patches → coordinator commit → seal receipt
Truth      → BroccoliDB graph + governed receipts on disk
```

Crossing a boundary — mutating without approval, skipping hooks when enabled, completing without gate passage — is misuse the pipeline is designed to block or surface.

---

## III. Comfort without surrender

The webview north star (`webview-ui/docs/LUMI_UX.md`):

> Can someone keep this open all day without feeling managed by it?

That is not softness about safety. It is **respect for attention**:

- Copy lives in `webview-ui/src/copy/lumiVoice.ts` — conversational, not alarmist.
- Long sessions use comfort hooks (`useLumiSessionComfort.ts`) — reduce visual noise, not reduce gates.
- Audit presentation reads like a notebook (`auditUiStyles.ts`), not a tribunal.

**Calm is not passive.** LUMI still shows every diff. It still asks before `execute_command`. It still runs completion gates before `attempt_completion` succeeds. For governed swarms, the **incident console** (`GovernedReceiptPanel`) shows execution mode, lock skipped/required, accepted/rejected patches, rebase outcomes, and commit status — so operators see what each agent proposed without false "missing lock" alarms on read lanes.

Teachability is trust. If the UI hides what the agent did, the companion has failed. If the UI cries "missing lock" on a read-only audit lane, the companion has also failed.

---

## IV. Plan and Act are ethical partitions

Modes (`src/shared/storage/types.ts`: `"plan" | "act"`) are not difficulty settings. They are **posture**:

| Mode | Tool | Philosophy |
|------|------|------------|
| **Plan** | `plan_mode_respond` | Understand before touching — read, search, discuss |
| **Act** | `act_mode_respond` | Implement with explicit tool approval |

Plan and Act can use **different providers** (`planModeApiProvider`, `actModeApiProvider`). Thinking cheaply and acting precisely is a design affordance, not a hack.

`/replan` exists because direction changes mid-task are normal — not failures. The agent should pivot without pretending the old plan never happened.

---

## V. Approval is the contract

LUMI's power is physical access: files, shell, browser, MCP. The contract:

1. **Propose** — tool call visible in chat with parameters.
2. **Review** — diff view for edits; output preview for commands.
3. **Consent** — user approves, rejects, or auto-approve rule matches.
4. **Execute** — host bridge performs the action.
5. **Record** — result returns to conversation; hooks fire.

`READ_ONLY_TOOLS` in `src/shared/tools.ts` (12 tools) may run without blocking checkpoint commits — exploration should not feel like negotiation. **Mutation always earns scrutiny** unless you explicitly configure otherwise.

Auto-approve is opt-in trust, not default autonomy.

---

## VI. Completion is gated, not declared

Any agent can say "I'm done." LUMI treats `attempt_completion` as a **request**, not a fact.

Completion eligibility flows through a deterministic four-stage spine — no handler, utility, or pipeline stage may independently decide whether a task is allowed to complete:

| Stage | Role | Source |
|-------|------|--------|
| **Snapshot builder** | Reads mutable task state once, produces an immutable `CompletionLifecycleSnapshot` | `completionSnapshotBuilder.ts` |
| **Decision engine** | Pure function over the snapshot — returns one canonical decision with a full trace | `CompletionLifecycleDecisionEngine.ts` |
| **Action contract** | The decision carries `nextAllowedAction`, `forbiddenActions`, and a one-line `canonicalInstruction` | `CompletionLifecycleTypes.ts` |
| **Action guard** | Enforces the contract at the tool boundary — rejects forbidden actions without mutating counters | `CompletionActionGuard.ts` |

**The agent receives a command, not a prose explanation to interpret.**

This closes the real failure chain that existed before the spine:

> stale state → ghost audit → wrong interpretation → retry loop → circuit breaker spiral

The spine replaces it with:

> snapshot → decision → permitted action → guard enforcement

That is boring in the exact right way.

The decision engine evaluates: audit validity (strict AND — cache key + graph revision + TTL + gate active), workspace progress (checkpoint hash change detection), duplicate suppression (result fingerprint + workspace hash), circuit breaker state (closed / tripped / half-open probe), engineering verification, and finalization routing. Every decision emits a structured trace showing each evaluated stage.

`completionGatePipeline.ts` orchestrates the preflight stages (quality, focus chain, roadmap, audit score). The decision engine is the single authority that consumes those results and returns one binding action contract. The action guard enforces it before any handler executes.

Philosophy encoded as the spine:

1. Did the work match the stated task?
2. Did audit/policy pass?
3. Did roadmap steering agree (when enabled)?
4. Only then — present completion to the user.

BroccoliDB proves structure; LUMI proves **the session earned its ending** — and the agent earns it by receiving a command, not by interpreting prose.

**See:** [Completion lifecycle decision engine](../completion-lifecycle-decision-engine.md) for full architecture, action contracts, and enforcement model.

## VI-A. Swarm success is gated, not declared

A parent can spawn five subagents and call the swarm "done." LUMI treats swarm success as a **reconciliation outcome**, not a chat assertion.

The governed harness mirrors single-task completion discipline at swarm scale:

| Single task | Governed swarm | Shared philosophy |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| `attempt_completion` | `sealReceipt` / `sealCrashReceipt` after `runMergeGate` | Success is requested, then verified |
| `completionGatePipeline` | Preflight + per-lane `completion_gate`; `MergeGate` at seal | Fail closed — violations block pass |
| Roadmap gates at completion | Pressure + orchestration lease at admit; patch reconciliation + coordinator commit at seal | Roadmap owns plan/admission — workspace truth is expensive |
| User sees why completion blocked | `GovernedReceiptPanel` violations + rejected patch reasons | Teachability over vibes |
| Checkpoints preserve rollback | `attemptId` + `history.jsonl` lineage | Truth survives retries |

**Three gates, one posture** — same calm agency at every layer:

1. **Tool gate** — approve mutating tool calls (or explicit auto-approve).
2. **Task gate** — `completionGatePipeline` before the session ends.
3. **Swarm gate** — `MergeGate` + patch reconciliation before parallel lanes merge into success.

Swarm gate rules encode intent, not suspicion:

- Read-only lanes reading the same file do not collide.
- Mutation lanes writing the same path in parallel do.
- Lanes that skip locks still emit receipts — **receipts preserve truth** even when **locks protect mutation**.
- Lanes may maintain private `agentRoadmap` projections freely — **only the coordinator may spend workspace roadmap truth**.

### Roadmap projection doctrine

Parallel subagents must not fight over the shared kanban. LUMI encodes a CQRS-like split:

| Plane | Cost | Who mutates |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `agentRoadmap` | Cheap | Lane agent — local events, private todos, progress notes |
| `swarmRoadmap` | Cheap | Coordinator — read-only plan linkage |
| `workspaceRoadmap` | Expensive | Coordinator only — after evidence-backed patch reconciliation |

Agents propose; they do not directly mutate workspace roadmap. `proposedWorkspacePatch` carries evidence, rationale, expected transition, and conflict policy. Vague or smuggled mutations are rejected. Local events that imply authoritative change are converted to patches or blocked.

This is the same philosophy as single-task approval — **propose, verify, then commit** — applied to parallel roadmap state.

The lock-necessity classifier exists because the earlier failure mode was not vague prompts — it was **false-positive ownership**: audit lanes acquiring mutation locks they never needed, creating stale claims, merge failures, and operator noise.

Vague escalation prompts remain allowed. Over-locking does not.

---

## VII. Extension without chaos

MCP, hooks, skills, workflows, and subagents extend LUMI — they do not bypass it:

| Extension | Boundary |
|-----------|----------|
| **MCP** | External tools still flow through `use_mcp_tool` + approval |
| **Hooks** | 8 lifecycle points; can cancel or modify context, not silently mutate disk |
| **Skills** | On-demand via `use_skill` — not always-on prompt bloat |
| **Workflows** | Slash-invoked markdown — explicit, not ambient |
| **Subagents** | `use_subagents` + dynamic handlers — same hook and approval inheritance |
| **Governed swarms** | Parent coordinates; lanes declare execution mode; merge gate before success |

The agent layer refuses to become an ungoverned plugin host. Extensions attach to **tool contracts**, not raw filesystem access.

### Governed parallelism (locks protect mutation; receipts preserve truth)

Parallel subagents are not a license to collide. The harness separates **ownership**, **evidence**, and **roadmap projection**:

| Concern | Mechanism | Philosophy |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| Who may mutate files? | `LockAuthority` — only when `classifyLockNecessity()` says so | Read/audit lanes should not fight over files they only inspect |
| Who may mutate workspace roadmap? | `commitWorkspaceRoadmapPatches` under `roadmap:workspace` lock | Private projection is cheap; workspace truth is coordinator-owned |
| What happened? | `LaneExecutionReceipt` per lane — with or without `claimId` | Chat is not the audit trail; receipts are |
| What did agents propose? | `proposedWorkspacePatch` + `localRoadmapEvents` | Operators see intent before commit |
| Is merge safe? | `MergeGate` + `runRoadmapPatchReconciliation` | Parallel reads pass; uncoordinated writes and conflicting patches fail |
| Can operator trust status? | `GovernedReceiptPanel` incident console | Calm UX shows mode, patches, rebase, commit status — not false alarms |

Six **execution modes** (`read_only`, `audit_only`, `planning_only`, `documentation_only`, `diagnostic_only`, `mutation`) let harness authors opt out of mutation locks without opting out of durability. Default unmarked lanes remain `mutation` — backward compatible with edit-heavy swarms.

**Industry posture (without pretending we are a distributed database):** leases and fencing tokens for mutation ownership; optimistic parallel execution with merge-before-commit; append-only receipt lineage. Familiar patterns, editor-local implementation.

| Practitioner concept | LUMI expression |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| Lease | In-process claim TTL + file lock under `.broccolidb/governed/locks/` |
| Fencing token | `fencingToken` + broccoli fence file — stale primary cannot release blindly |
| OCC / merge gate | Lanes run in parallel; `MergeGate` reconciles write sets; patches reconciled at seal |
| CQRS / projection | Per-lane `agentRoadmap` + `proposedWorkspacePatch` → coordinator commit |
| Event log | `claimHistory`, `.governed.history.jsonl`, transcript `.jsonl` |
| Workflow run ID | `attemptId` + `parentAttemptId` retry chain |

Vague escalation prompts are not blocked by default. False-positive locks are. That is the lock-necessity pass in code, not a vibe.

**Harness author rule of thumb:** if a lane only reads, inspects, plans, or appends diagnostic evidence — declare `[execution_mode:read_only]` (or audit/plan/doc/diagnostic). If it edits files — `mutation` or `[write_set:…]`. If it updates roadmap state — `[propose_patch:…]` with evidence, never direct kanban writes. Use `[local_roadmap:progress_note:…]` for private progress only.

## VIII. What the workspace refuses

Observed absences are design choices:

| Refusal | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| Silent file writes | Write handlers require approval path |
| Mystery provider routing | `providers.json` lists 4 wired providers; `buildApiHandler` matches |
| Chat as sole memory | BroccoliDB cognitive tools + disk persistence |
| IDE lock-in at core | `HostProvider` abstracts VS Code; core avoids direct `vscode` imports |
| Completion on vibes | `completionGatePipeline` + tests in `attemptCompletionUtils.test.ts` |
| Parallel swarm chaos | `MergeGate` + lock-necessity + patch reconciliation + roadmap orchestration lease |
| Direct parallel kanban mutation | Per-agent projection + coordinator-only `roadmap:workspace` commit |
| Smuggled roadmap state in local events | `containLocalRoadmapEvents` — reject or convert to patch |
| Chat as swarm audit trail | Governed receipt v3 + `auditIntegration` + `history.jsonl` |
| BroccoliDB as swarm audit store | Receipt-local audit under `subagent_executions/`; BroccoliDB = substrate |
| Companion without substrate | `@noorm/broccolidb` dependency in root `package.json` |

We refuse another headless agent framework because developers already live in an editor. LUMI meets them **in the sidebar they already trust**.

---

## IX. Relationship to BroccoliDB

| Layer | Package | Question it answers |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| **LUMI** | Root extension | "What should we do in this session, with my consent?" |
| **LUMI governed receipts** | `subagent_executions/*.governed.*` | "What did each swarm lane do, what patches were accepted/rejected, was merge safe, and what did audit/roadmap record?" |
| **BroccoliDB** | `@noorm/broccolidb` | "What happened to the repository, and is structure still true?" |

LUMI calls BroccoliDB through cognitive memory tools, `dietcode_kernel`, and Spider integration in `src/core/policy/spider/`. Governed swarm receipts live in the **session artifact layer** (per-task `subagent_executions/`), not in chat memory and not in BroccoliDB CAS audit events. The companion proposes; the substrate proves and persists; **swarm receipts record parallel lane truth without conflating locks with evidence**.

**Final invariant across planes:** Agent roadmap owns private projection. Swarm roadmap owns plan linkage. Workspace roadmap owns authoritative kanban — coordinator commit only. Audit owns verification. MergeGate owns file + roadmap audit commit barrier. BroccoliDB owns fencing/replay substrate. Receipts own truth.

Read BroccoliDB's papers for substrate philosophy. Read LUMI's papers for session philosophy. **Do not merge them.**

---

## X. Measure of done

Done is falsifiable:

```bash
npm run check-types && npm run test:unit
npm run test:unit -- --grep "governed execution"
npm run package   # produces installable VSIX
```

Done is a developer installing `CardSorting.lumi`, running a task, approving one edit, and feeling **in control** — not supervised.

Done is `/compact` recovering a long session without losing decisions.

Done is `attempt_completion` blocked when roadmap validation pending — and the user understanding why.

Done is a governed swarm where read-only review lanes show **lock skipped** in the incident console — and the operator does not file a false "missing lock" ticket.

Done is merge blocked on `unsafe mutation overlap` — not on two auditors reading the same file.

Done is a swarm where lanes propose `[propose_patch:attach_evidence:…]` with evidence pointers — and the incident console shows **accepted patches: 1**, **commit: committed**.

Done is a rejected `mark_complete` patch with a visible reason (`missing evidence pointer`) — not a silent kanban no-op.

Done is a swarm that passes roadmap pressure admission, acquires projections and orchestration lease, runs DAG-ordered lanes, reconciles patches, and seals a receipt where `auditIntegration.mergeGateRole` is `commit_barrier` — not confused with workspace audit.

Done is a timeout that produces `sealCrashReceipt` with a precise crash phase — without overwriting a prior sealed success in history.

When teams stop discussing LUMI's sidebar and return to discussing their product, the companion has succeeded.

---

## XI. Closing doctrine

Build a companion that **respects attention** in the webview.  
Build a controller that **holds one task** honestly.  
Build a loop that **streams, parses, and executes** through typed tools.  
Build approval that **defaults to ask**, not assume.  
Build Plan and Act as **separate postures**, not labels.  
Build completion that **passes gates**, not wishes.  
Build extensions that **attach to tools**, not bypass them.  
Build governed swarms where **locks protect mutation** and **receipts preserve truth**.  
Build roadmap parallelism where **private projection is cheap** and **workspace truth is coordinator-owned**.  
Build memory on **BroccoliDB**, not chat scrollback.

Then stop adding agent features and start **refining the session**.

That is the philosophy of LUMI — as implemented in this workspace.
