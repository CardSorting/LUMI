# LUMI Companion Brief

**Executive summary · v5.5.2 · workspace-verified**

*Companion to the [Technical Whitepaper](whitepaper.md). All figures below are measured from the agent workspace (`src/`, `webview-ui/`, root `package.json`).*

---

## One sentence

**LUMI** (`CardSorting.lumi-vscode` on VS Marketplace, `CardSorting.lumi` on Open VSX) is a VS Code agent extension in the [LUMI monorepo](https://github.com/CardSorting/LUMI): Plan/Act modes, 64 typed tools, human-in-the-loop approval, MCP and governed subagent execution, and BroccoliDB-backed memory — designed as a calm coding companion you can keep open all day.

## What problem it solves

Developers want an AI pair programmer **inside the editor** — not a separate app, not a black box, not an autonomous script. LUMI delivers:

| Need | LUMI answer |
|------|-------------|
| See what changed before it lands | Diff view + approve/reject per tool |
| Long sessions without context collapse | `/compact`, `summarize_task`, BroccoliDB memory tools |
| Plan before mutating | Plan mode + `plan_mode_respond` |
| Extend with company tools | MCP via `use_mcp_tool` |
| Delegate parallel work | `use_subagents` + dynamic subagent tools |
| Parallel review without lock fights | `[execution_mode:read_only]` lanes — lock skipped, receipt durable |
| Reconcile parallel writes | `MergeGate` — optimistic execution, write-set collision check at seal |
| Update workspace roadmap safely | Per-lane `agentRoadmap` projection + `propose_patch` → coordinator commit |
| Inspect swarm incidents | `GovernedReceiptPanel` — mode, patches, rebase, commit status, violations |
| Steer multi-step projects | `ROADMAP.md` + `roadmap` / `roadmap_checkpoint` tools |
| Custom guardrails | Hooks (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, …) + `.dietcoderules/` |

**BroccoliDB** underneath answers forensic repository questions. **LUMI** answers session questions — in the sidebar. **Governed receipts** answer swarm questions — on disk, not in chat.

---

## Three gates (same product posture)

LUMI applies **fail-closed verification** at three layers. All three favor teachability over silent success.

| Gate | Trigger | Blocks when | Operator surface |
|------|---------|-------------|------------------|
| **Tool** | Mutating tool call | User rejects (or hook cancels) | Diff view + approval card |
| **Task** | `attempt_completion` | `completionGatePipeline` fails | Model guidance + roadmap messages |
| **Swarm** | `use_subagents` seal | `MergeGate` + patch reconciliation fail | `GovernedReceiptPanel` violations + rejected patch reasons |

Swarm gate is **mutation-scoped**: parallel reads pass; parallel uncoordinated writes fail. Workspace roadmap changes require evidence-backed patches reconciled at seal — not direct lane writes.

**Completion spine (task gate):** `attempt_completion` flows through a four-stage deterministic spine — snapshot builder → decision engine → action contract → action guard. The agent receives a command, not a prose explanation to interpret. See [Completion lifecycle decision engine](../completion-lifecycle-decision-engine.md).

## Architecture (10 seconds)

```
User → webview-ui (React)
         ↕ protobuf / gRPC handlers
       Controller → Task loop
         ↕ buildApiHandler (4 providers)
       LLM stream → ToolExecutorCoordinator → HostProvider.hostBridge
         ↕
       VS Code (files, terminal, diff, browser)
         ↕
       @noorm/broccolidb (memory, Spider, kernel)

Governed swarm branch (use_subagents):
  SubagentToolHandler
    → scheduleAdmission (pressure) → acquireOrchestrationLease (ownership)
    → audit preflight → GovernedSwarmCoordinator
    → LockNecessity (classify) → agentRoadmap projection per lane → LaneDAG (depends_on)
    → LockAuthority (file mutation only) → SubagentRunner (lanes)
    → local events + proposedWorkspacePatch → completion_gate per lane
    → MergeGate (commit barrier) → patch reconciliation → coordinator workspace commit
    → sealReceipt v3 / sealCrashReceipt on timeout
    → GovernedReceiptPanel (incident console)
```

**Hard rules:** mutating tools require approval (unless auto-approve); `attempt_completion` runs `completionGatePipeline`; hooks can cancel but do not silently write files; swarm success requires merge gate pass + patch reconciliation; workspace roadmap commits are coordinator-only under `roadmap:workspace` lock; roadmap orchestration lease must succeed before lanes run; timeout/abort seals via `sealCrashReceipt` — **locks protect mutation, receipts preserve truth, private projection is cheap**.

**Coordination planes:** Agent roadmap owns private projection. Swarm roadmap owns plan linkage. Workspace roadmap owns authoritative kanban (coordinator commit only). Roadmap service owns admission. Audit owns verification. MergeGate owns commit barrier. BroccoliDB owns fencing/replay substrate. Receipts own truth under `subagent_executions/`.

---

## Governed subagent execution (30 seconds)

Multi-lane swarms are not fire-and-forget parallelism. Each lane declares an **execution mode** before acquire:

| Mode | Lock | Use |
|------|------|-----|
| `read_only`, `audit_only`, `planning_only`, `documentation_only`, `diagnostic_only` | skipped | Review, audit, plan — durable receipt, no ownership |
| `mutation` (default) | required | File edits, durable state changes |

**Invariant:** Locks protect mutation. Receipts preserve truth. Private roadmap state is cheap — workspace roadmap truth is expensive; only the coordinator may spend it.

| Artifact | Path |
|----------|------|
| Per-attempt receipt | `subagent_executions/{swarmId}.governed.{attemptId}.json` |
| Attempt lineage | `subagent_executions/{swarmId}.governed.history.jsonl` |
| Swarm envelope | `subagent_executions/{swarmId}.json` |

Receipt fields for projection: `agentRoadmapId`, `localRoadmapEvents`, `proposedWorkspacePatch`, `roadmapLinkage.patchReconciliation`, `roadmapLinkage.workspaceCommit`.

Authoritative state after a failed retry: last `sealed && mergePassed` in history — not chat status alone.

### Roadmap projection (lanes do not write kanban directly)

| Action | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Private progress | `[local_roadmap:progress_note:ITEM:…]` → `localRoadmapEvents` |
| Propose workspace change | `[propose_patch:attach_evidence:ITEM:evidence=…\|rationale=…]` |
| Reconcile at seal | `runRoadmapPatchReconciliation` — quality gate, rebase, conflict merge |
| Commit workspace | `commitWorkspaceRoadmapPatches` — coordinator + `roadmap:workspace` lock |

Per-lane `roadmap:*` locks at acquire are **not used** (`requiresRoadmapMutationLock()` returns false). Direct workspace kanban writes are flagged as violations.

### Scenario matrix

| Setup | Lock behavior | Merge expectation |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|
| 2× `[execution_mode:read_only]` on same file | Both **lock skipped** | Pass — read overlap OK |
| 2× `mutation` writing same file in parallel | Both **lock required** | Fail — `unsafe mutation overlap` |
| 1× read + 1× mutation on same file | Read skipped, mutation locked | Pass if only mutation writes |
| `documentation_only` + `[write_set:docs/x.md]` | Escalated to lock | Pass when claim acquired + released |
| Audit lane runs `write_to_file` without lock | Skipped at acquire | Fail — `performed writes without lock` |
| Lane writes workspace kanban directly | No per-lane roadmap lock | Fail — `directWorkspaceRoadmapMutation` or smuggled local event |
| Two lanes propose compatible `attach_evidence` | Projections independent | Pass — patches merge at reconciliation |
| Two lanes propose conflicting `move_lane` on same item | Projections independent | Fail — `conflicting workspace patches` |

### Prompt examples

```
[execution_mode:read_only] [read_set:src/api.ts]
Review the public API. Do not modify files.
```

```
[execution_mode:audit_only]
Inspect subagent_executions/{swarmId}.governed.{attemptId}.json and summarize merge violations.
```

```
[execution_mode:mutation]
[roadmap_item:NOW-42]
[local_roadmap:progress_note:NOW-42:implementing feature]
[propose_patch:attach_evidence:NOW-42:evidence=tests/feature.test.ts|rationale=tests pass|confidence=0.9]
Refactor src/handler.ts and update tests. Do not mutate workspace roadmap directly.
```

Tool param alternatives: `execution_mode_1=read_only`, `depends_on_2=0`, `roadmap_item_1=NOW-42`, `roadmap_completion_update=enabled` (legacy completion policy on sealed success; patch commit is primary path).

### Incident console (operator)

`deriveReceiptIncident()` classifies receipts for the sidebar. Common classes:

| Incident | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `sealed_success` | Merge passed — safe to treat complete |
| `merge_blocked` | Read violations list — often overlap or missing evidence |
| `partial_receipt` | Interrupted before seal — check claim timeline |
| `stale_claim` | Recover mutation locks before retry |
| `unsafe_retry` | Would supersede sealed prior attempt |
| `replay_mismatch` | Receipt or envelope drift after seal |

**Not an incident:** `lock skipped` on read/audit lanes — expected, not missing lock.

---

## Modes (actual code)

| Mode | Response tool | Typical posture |
|------|---------------|-----------------|
| `plan` | `plan_mode_respond` | Read, search, discuss — no writes |
| `act` | `act_mode_respond` | Implement — mutating tools with approval |

Each mode can use a **different provider and model** (`planModeApiProvider`, `actModeApiProvider`).

---

## Wired providers (this build)

| Key | Label |
|-----|-------|
| `openrouter` | OpenRouter (default fallback) |
| `openai-codex` | ChatGPT Subscription |
| `nousResearch` | NousResearch |
| `cloudflare` | Cloudflare Workers AI |

Additional provider files exist under `src/core/api/providers/` but are **not registered** in `buildApiHandler` today.

---

## Tool categories (summary)

| Category | Examples | Count (enum) |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| File I/O | `read_file`, `write_to_file`, `apply_patch` | 9 |
| Terminal / web / browser | `execute_command`, `web_fetch`, `browser_action` | 4 |
| MCP | `use_mcp_tool`, `access_mcp_resource` | 3 |
| Interaction | `ask_followup_question`, `attempt_completion` | 6 |
| Cognitive memory | `query_cognitive_memory`, `mem_*` | 21 |
| Stability | `diagnose_stability`, `ast_repair`, … | 8 |
| Roadmap / kernel | `roadmap`, `dietcode_kernel` | 3 |
| Modes / meta | `plan_mode_respond`, `use_subagents`, … | 8 |
| Governed harness | `GovernedSwarmCoordinator`, `MergeGate`, `LockNecessity`, `AgentRoadmapProjection`, `RoadmapPatchReconciler`, `RoadmapWorkspaceCommit` | — |

Full list: [All tools](../tools-reference/all-dietcode-tools.mdx). Swarm depth: [Governed subagent execution](../governed-subagent-execution.md).

## Integration checklist (extension user)

- [ ] Install `CardSorting.lumi-vscode` or `CardSorting.lumi` (VSIX or marketplace)
- [ ] Configure Plan and/or Act provider + API key
- [ ] Add `.dietcodeignore` for deps and secrets
- [ ] Optional: `.dietcoderules/` for project rules
- [ ] Optional: MCP servers in LUMI settings
- [ ] Optional: `lumi.roadmap.enabled` for ROADMAP.md steering
- [ ] Optional: hooks in `.dietcoderules/hooks/`
- [ ] Parallel subagents: use `[execution_mode:read_only]` on review lanes; use `[propose_patch:…]` for roadmap updates, not direct kanban writes

---

## Integration checklist (contributor)

- [ ] `npm run install:all && npm run dev`
- [ ] New tools: add to `DietCodeDefaultTool` + handler + `ToolExecutorCoordinator` map
- [ ] New providers: handler in `src/core/api/providers/` + register in `buildApiHandler` + `providers.json`
- [ ] Webview copy: `webview-ui/src/copy/lumiVoice.ts` — keep calm tone
- [ ] Host-specific code only under `src/hosts/vscode/`
- [ ] Do not import `vscode` from `src/core/task/` — use `HostProvider`
- [ ] Governed swarms: update coordinator, `GovernedIntegration`, `MergeGate`, or receipt types → sync [governed docs](../governed-subagent-execution.md) + `CODE_TO_DOC_MAP.md`
